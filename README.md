# WagonWheels

This Project was wayyyy super hard and I don't feel confident in thiw work. The speed of this class has not been easy for me and I've done the best I can with what I know. 
I took a lot of inclass code-along example codes to help me get started, but I am missing too much to continue and to even debugg this intime for the due date. 

The App was created to help people connect directly with their farmer and to become even more informed about their local food movement. 
I implimented the following technoloigies in the building process and within the app itself: 
    - React, materialize, router-dom
     - materialize-css
     - axios
     - body-parser
    - concurrently
    - dotenv
    - express
    - styled-components
    - nodemon
    - mongo
    - heroku
    - postinstall
    - postman
    - gitHub
    - trello
    - figma
